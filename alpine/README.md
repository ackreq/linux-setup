# Alpine Setup Scripts

These scripts automate the setup process for **Alpine Linux**, including:

- Installing a desktop environment
- Installing essential tools and utilities
- Installing development tools

They can be used to quickly configure a system for **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)** labs, development, or general-purpose use.

## Prerequisites

- A fresh installation of Alpine
- A user account with root privileges

> [!Important]
> Before running the setup scripts, make sure `bash` is installed (and ideally set as your default shell). If you also prefer `sudo` instead of Alpineâ€™s default `doas`, perform the following steps **as the root user**:
>
> 1. Install `bash` and set it as the default shell:
>
>    ```sh
>    apk update && apk add bash bash-completion shadow
>    chsh -s $(which bash) <USERNAME>
>    ```
>
> 2. Install the `sudo` package (as the equivalent to _doas_):
>
>    ```sh
>    apk add sudo
>    usermod -aG wheel <USERNAME>
>    ```
>
> 3. Reboot and log back in for the changes to take effect.
